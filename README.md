# Named-Entity-Recognition-Using-LSTM
A project using a bidirectional LSTM model in Keras/TensorFlow to classify named entities like persons, organizations, and locations in text data. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation with accuracy and loss visualizations for performance tracking.
## What the Project Does
This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) on text data using a bidirectional LSTM model. The primary goal is to recognize and classify named entities in text, such as persons, organizations, locations, etc. The model is trained to identify these entities in sentences and tag them according to the IOB-2 scheme.
